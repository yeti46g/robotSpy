# RobotSpy: a Data Science Dashboard Project

 - Skills: Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly); Web Development (Flask, Heroku)


### About

The RobotSpy is a data dashboard for an entrepreneur client. The client has an in-development technology that is a state-of-art bio-mimic robot gripper. Before launching his start-up company, the client wishes to understand the robotics industry better, including the industry landscape, the competitors, the potential industry customer, as well as the investors. I propose to develop the RobotSpy web application for his specific purpose. <br>

RobotSpy will feature a data dashboard for key descriptive statistics of the robotics industry with interactively plotting. It will also leverage machine learning tools such as clustering and NLP to derive hidden insights of the industry landscape. The web app will be powered by Crunchbase database API, Python Flask framework, Plotly Dash framework, and Heroku platform. The tool could be later expanded for analysis of industries outside of robotics. It could potentially be an internal tool for management consulting and venture capital investing firms.
